adcClient.py is run on a Raspberry Pi. It needs the numpy, time, board, busio, socket, json, and adafruit_ads1x15 libraries to run. The script needs to be given the corret IP and port of the server. An Adafruit ads1015 ADC needs to be connected to the Raspberry Pi over I2C to run properly. 

plotServer.py is run on another computer on the same network. It needs the socket, json, time, numpy, matplotlib, sys, keyboard, and pickle libraries. It also needs the file notes.py. The script needs to be given the corret IP and port of the server. adcClient.py needs to be running and have detected a guitar signal for any output to be displayed on plotServer.

playback.py is run on the same computer as plotServer.py. It needs the pyaudio, mumpy, pickle, and time libraries to run. I had to brew install portaudio on Mac for pyaudio to work. It also needs the file notes.py. This script needs a recording to have been generated by plotServer.  

notes.py is a file that contains a dictionary of frequency/note name pairs. This is used by both plotServer.py and playback.py. 

recording.pkl is a file containing the note information. This can be used to test playback.py
